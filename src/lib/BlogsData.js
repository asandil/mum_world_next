Other times you may notice sweating or dampness in specific areas, like the hands, feet, or head. Again, this is quite normal. Humans just have more sweat glands in certain areas.Read this post to learn about the causes and treatment for babies sweating at night and know when to consult a doctor.",

The stratum basalis is attached to a layer of smooth muscle tissue of the uterus known as the myometrium. This layer serves as an anchor for the endometrium of the uterus and remains relatively unchanged.\nHowever, the second layer is dynamic and changes in response to the monthly hormone flow that guides the menstrual cycle. Because of this reason, it is called the functional layer or stratum functionalis. It is the part of the endometrium where the fertilized egg will implant if the female conceives.",

These contractions signify false labor as there is a pain but no dilation of the cervix. They are perfectly normal and have been said to represent contractions that occur as the uterus is preparing to give birth.\nBraxton Hicks contractions are typically less painful than those of true labor and are unpredictable, do not occur at regular intervals. Braxton Hicks contractions do not become more intense over time. Dehydration and physical activity may trigger Braxton Hicks contractions.\nAs your due date approaches, you begin to guard for every possible sign of labor, thinking if it is real labor or not. However, differentiating between real and false labor is quite difficult because some signs and contractions are identical in both scenarios. Therefore, it's difficult to distinguish false labor so you don't stress out every time.\nThis post explains the indicators of labor signs and tells you the differences between false and real ones.",

Later, its uses diversified to soothing common problems in babies such as colic, teething pain, hiccups, and other tummy troubles. The initial formulation contained alcohol. Currently, alcohol-based gripe water is discontinued due to the adverse effects of alcohol on babies. These days, most gripe water brands use sodium bicarbonate, sugar, and a few herbs such as dill seed oil, peppermint, fennel, chamomile, or ginger. They may also contain other artificial flavors. It may be noted that gripe water is not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since it is marketed as an herbal supplement and not a medicine.
