Other times you may notice sweating or dampness in specific areas, like the hands, feet, or head. Again, this is quite normal. Humans just have more sweat glands in certain areas.Read this post to learn about the causes and treatment for babies sweating at night and know when to consult a doctor.",

The single-layered prismatic epithelium consists of three types of cells: secretory cells, cells with cilia, and basal cells.\nThe uterus is one of the few organs of the human body which changes in size every month, throughout the female's fertile years.\nThe endometrium is mostly made up of mucosal tissue and has two layers, the stratum basalis and the stratum functionalis. The stratum basalis is attached to a layer of smooth muscle tissue of the uterus known as the myometrium. This layer serves as an anchor for the endometrium of the uterus and remains relatively unchanged.\nHowever, the second layer is dynamic and changes in response to the monthly hormone flow that guides the menstrual cycle. Because of this reason, it is called the functional layer or stratum functionalis. It is the part of the endometrium where the fertilized egg will implant if the female conceives.",

The endometrium is the uterine lining where the embryo implants to commence pregnancy.\nThe endometrium's thickness changes in each pregnancy month, and it is also a parameter assessed during imaging tests, ultrasound scans.
