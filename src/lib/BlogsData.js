If you feel extremely depressed and have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby, you should speak to your doctor.",

Although it might worry you to see your baby sweating in sleep, it’s not always a sign of a medical condition.Why does it happen? Well, for one thing, a baby’s body is immature and still learning to regulate its own temperature. And at the same time, babies are often overdressed and get hot, but they can’t do anything themselves to fix the problem — or let you know what the problem is.Sometimes babies sweat all over. Other times you may notice sweating or dampness in specific areas, like the hands, feet, or head. Again, this is quite normal. Humans just have more sweat glands in certain areas.Read this post to learn about the causes and treatment for babies sweating at night and know when to consult a doctor.",
