      "The first 40 days after childbirth are the most important days for a woman. Both my deliveries were by C-section. At the time of my first child, I was not aware about the care that needs to be taken, and therefore I faced a difficult time.I faced cysts, heavy and painful periods, hormonal imbalance, severe pain in body, and more even after taking calcium and iron supplements.\n\nThe practices during these days may vary depending on which part of the country you are from. But largely, the first 40 days are seen as a confinement period, meant for you to recuperate, gain strength and bond with your new baby.\nIt's quite natural to feel that 40 days is too long. You may want to get out of the house before that. Or you may find all the dos and don't that this period comes with too restrictive.\n\nIf your recovery is taking longer than you expected though, you will probably be happy for the excuse of these 40 days to get all the rest you need.\n\nHowever long you end up spending on your confinement, enjoy this precious time you get for yourself and your newborn baby before the mad rush of life sets in again. Your body will be going through a lot during these first few days of motherhood. Here is how you can make the most of the confinement time to help you recover well.\n\n### In this phase lots of questions will omes in your mind like:\n\n**How can I recover quickly after birth?**\n\nDepending on your birth experience, you may feel well again fairly soon after the birth. But it can also seem like a long time before you are free from aches and pains, especially if you had a caesarean birth.\n\n<!-- ![meal](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/7d906beb-bc9b-4377-9b06-b22a3566899c/images.jpeg-112.jpg/:/rs=w:1280) -->\n\nIt is best to allow your body to heal at it's own pace. You can help yourself heal by resting, eating well and looking out for the signs of an infection or other postnatal complication.\n\n**How will I feel emotionally after birth?**\n\nEvery mum responds in her own way. You may feel happy - physically, mentally, and emotionally satisfied. Or you may feel exhausted, disappointed and even depressed. You may find that you feel very protective and possessive of your baby or on the other hand, happy when someone offers to take care of him for a while.\n\n<!-- ![emotion](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/7d906beb-bc9b-4377-9b06-b22a3566899c/download.jpeg-33.jpg/:/rs=w:1280) -->\n\nMany new mums also get the baby blues and a few suffer from more serious postnatal depression. This can cause severe mood swings, sadness and guilt. If you feel extremely depressed and have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby, you should speak to your doctor. With the right treatment, you will feel better again.\n\n**Breastfeeding your baby-**\n\nDoctors and Medical experts recommend breastfeeding your baby exclusively for six months.\n\nThough it is the best nourishment for your little one and the most natural one, breastfeeding doesn't always happen easily. You may have starting troubles. And it's quite normal to have problems like swollen breasts, breast refusal or sore nipples. In addition, the night-time feeds can take their toll on you.\nYou might find yourself very happy for the first few days of confinement to spend some quality time with your baby perfecting the art of breastfeeding.\n\n**Practices are usually done in the first 40 days:**\n\nLast year, I gave birth to my second baby. This time, I was aware, as I did a lot of research on postnatal care, and I consulted an ayurvedic doctor, too. I was prepared to take proper steps, and so my recovery was fast.\n\n### Following are the things I did:\n\n- As i am a vegetarian. I ate moong dal and chapatis with lemon for one month. After 1 month, I started eating green vegetables cooked in light spices.\n- If your a non-vegetarian, you can have boiled eggs for wound healing.\n- I took calcium supplements and iron supplements.\n\n### Now come the best things I did that saved me from all the horrible things I faced earlier:\n\n- I drank 2 to 3 litres of lukewarm water every day.\n- I prepared a herbal powder prescribed by an ayurvedic doctor, which I consumed daily after 10 days of delivery. This powder had turmeric (whole), dry ginger powder, nigella seeds, cumin, flaxseed, and methi. My periods were so easy and without pain. This powder helped me with weight loss, too.\n- I prepared dry fruits laddoo (panjeeri). \n\n<!-- ![Panjeeri laddoos](https://res.cloudinary.com/dc0wr8hev/image/upload/v1755937971/panjeri_laddu-_in_middle_of_blog-_postnatal_y90goy.jpg) -->\n\n- This laddoo strengthened me, and reduced pain in my body. You can have lactobites (easily available online).\n\n- I consumed soaked sunflower seed, watermelon seed, pumpkin seeds, Flaxseeds along with almond and Walnut in the morning\n- I consumed carom seed (ajwain) water, too.\n- I didn't climb stairs for 6 months. Only if it was very important I would go upstairs, and that also I did after 2 months had passed after delivery.\n- I did no heavy exercise. I took small walks.\n- I massaged my body with organic sesame oil after 10 days of delivery. I avoided my abdominal area.\n- I tied a C-section belt almost for 5 months.\n- I never sat on the bed without back support whenever I used to breastfeed my baby. I avoided pressure on my stitches by doing so.\n\nI stayed positive and meditated, too. I focused on my thoughts, and stayed away from stress. And thus, I recovered.\nI hope this can be a light for those who don't know what precautions to take after delivery.\n\n**Note: I shared my personal journey here.**",

          'Night sweats are defined as drenching sweats that require you to change your bedclothes. Excessive sweating in babies can affect their sleep. Although it might worry you to see your baby sweating in sleep, it’s not always a sign of a medical condition.Why does it happen? Well, for one thing, a baby’s body is immature and still learning to regulate its own temperature. And at the same time, babies are often overdressed and get hot, but they can’t do anything themselves to fix the problem — or let you know what the problem is.Sometimes babies sweat all over. Other times you may notice sweating or dampness in specific areas, like the hands, feet, or head. Again, this is quite normal. Humans just have more sweat glands in certain areas.Read this post to learn about the causes and treatment for babies sweating at night and know when to consult a doctor.',
